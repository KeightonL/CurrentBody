#CurrentBody Technical Test

The goal of this test is to take some JSON data and output it in the browser in a table so it can be
sorted by clicking on the table heads. The main focus of this test is the code itself. Visual styling
(in browser) will not be assessed, but it should look presentable.
Please use any tools/plugins which you feel necessary. 

To run the project please first install NPM
```javascript
npm install
```

After succesfully installling NPM please run the default gulp task
```javascript
gulp
```

After running gulp task BrowserSync will then open a new local tab with the project.

**Plugins**
For this project I made use of the Tablesort package that can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tablesort)
